hey what's up guys in this video i'm going to show  you how to create a full screen video background  
and react.js and we're also going to throw an  overlay on top of it in case you want to layer  
some text let's dive in so this is what we're  going to be building right here i'm going to close  
this down and we're going to be in vs code here  and basically this is just a react.js application  
that i just ran create react app in the command  line and then i've deleted all the extra files  
so here we are just a didn't that app.js so  what i'm going to do i'm going to delete this  
and first things to do i'm going to create a  couple folders here just an assets folder and  
also a component components folder now you don't  have to do this i'm just trying to keep things a  
best practice way so in this assets right here  this folder i'm going to drag in my video that  
we're going to be using and it is the video  bg.mp4 so i'm just going to set that in the re  
assets folder there and then in the components  folder i'm going to create a new component i'm  
going to call it main.jsx and i'm going to  generate a functional component here in this  
video it doesn't matter functional component class  based components does not matter for this tutorial  
so let's go ahead and import that in app.js so  i'm going to call main now go ahead and import  
that there there we go now whenever we type here  we should now see that on the screen there it is  
so what we want to do is in order to have access  to this video we need to import it and the way we  
import videos or images in react is we go here  to the top we're just going to import and then  
we can name our file i'm going to name it video  bg you can name it whatever you'd like from and  
then we've got to go find our file path here  so we're in the components folder we need to  
get out of this folder so it's going to be two  dots then go into the assets folder it's going  
to be video bg.mp4 now we have access to grab  our video so for this outer div i'm just going  
to give this a class name of main then in here  we're going to list out our video element okay  
so this is going to be a video then we need a  source and then we can go ahead and just close  
this now instead of the quotes and react we use  curly brackets here so and in here we should put  
the name of our file that we named it and we named  it video bg there we go so we should refresh now  
we see the video on our screen only uh problem is  it's not displaying properly and it's not playing  
so the way we fix this here we need to add some  properties to our video element so we can add the  
auto play we can add the loop and we can even add  muted even though there's no sound in here so now  
if we if we refresh air we should now see our our  video here starting to take form now we can our  
video is actually playing but we want this to take  up just the full width and height of the screen  
and right now it's overlapping we can't really  see the video so let's go in and add some css  
here so i'm just going to go into index.css and  i'm just going to kind of remove all this i'm just  
going to add a custom few things margin 0 we'll  do padding 0 and then let's add a font family  
let's do let's do impact it's pretty cool and  this is within react so you have access to  
this font within react so let's first grab our  our outer div here which is uh which is main  
we need to specify the width and also the height  of 100 or 100 viewport heights now for our video  
we did not give the video element a class name so  we can just grab it by the element which is video  
and let's give this a width of 100 we'll give  it a height of 100 and now we can do object  
fit and right now the object fit is set to contain  which is pretty nice but what i want to do is  
object cover because i want it to take up the full  width and height of the screen perfect so now as  
you can see when we scroll when we scroll around  our browser here it just stays within our browser  
um if you want to do back to contain that's fine  as well and if you do that you probably want to  
change the take away the height there so just  something to keep in mind so i'm going to change  
this back to 100 and object cover now let's add  some text to our um let's add some text to our  
video here just a little text right there in the  middle here so i'm going to go back into main.js  
and i'm going to type a div for the class name  of content and then here i'll have an h1 that  
says welcome and then a p tag i'll say to my site  okay so we can't see that now it's actually hidden  
behind this video in the upper corner here  so that div name is content so let's go ahead  
and grab that content now we want to position this  absolute and we'll say we'll say see width 100  
height 100 say top zero now let's uh display  this as flex and then so there it is at the  
top now you see it now let's do flex direction  we'll do column and let's put this right in  
the middle so we're gonna do justify content  center then align items to the center as well  
and i'm gonna make this text so i've been using  tailwind so that's where that came from text white  
there we go so that looks perfect that's what we  want now that's how we display uh full width video  
and react.js but what we want to do see this text  is kind of hard to read it'd be really nice if we  
could put a nice overlay behind it so we can  the text will pop out a little bit so let's do  
that right now let's go back into our main.jsx  we can actually close those so what we want to  
do we want to add a div here it doesn't really  matter where i'm going to add it at the top just  
below our video here so we'll have a div and i'm  just going to name that give it a class name of  
overlay so you can name it whatever you like  i'm going to name it overlay so now in here  
let's grab the overlay and we want to position  this absolute and then we'll say top 0  
left 0 width we want to take up 100 height 100  and this is of the parent container okay you guys  
and then we also want to give this a color now  i'm going to use rgba for the background color  
we'll say rgba and that takes  in a few values four values  
for black it's all zeros there and then the last  element is the alpha and we can kind of define the  
the how see-through our our color is here and i'm  gonna say 0.5 so if we go up to 0.9 it's going to  
be a lot darker notice you can barely see through  if you go down to 0.1 it's almost like it's not  
even there so i'm going to leave it around 0.4  now another way to do this if you're using the hex  
code here you can go down and say background color  for black is all zeros and then what you can do  
is add just cc at the end and now you  can see it gives it an overlay look so  
but i'm going to use i'm going to use the rgba  because it's a little bit easier to customize here  
and that is what we want right there you  guys that's how we display a full width video  
background in react.js and we added a nice overlay  so our text really pops out thanks for watching  
you guys i hope you liked it smash the like button  and i'll be putting out some more content just  
like this and react here in a few days so thanks  for watching you guys i'll see you on the next one
